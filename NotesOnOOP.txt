C# Language

Notes taken here

- Inheritance

-Opinion wise thought

Inheritance is seen as a shortcut for more cleaner, shorter and understandable code.
The idea is that you are able to create a good amount of classes but too much code isn't as efficent as it seems

-----------------

With inheritance you are able to create one class that can store properties
from another class and not have to repeat that same property(Repetitive Code).

-----------------

One big class, with sub classes


Inheritance can use any kind of method made and can use properties from different classes
and you can include those properties from that other class and not repeat code.

---------

- Facts

Some languages can use more then one Inheritance

C# cannot hold more then two inheritance

Ex. Human : GeneralObject, ColorEye These are two methods into one Method and
those 2 are inheriting their properties into Humans

-----------------

Example is creating a blueprint that can have 3 classes and reduce the code by using Inheritance



Space Complexity

- The Idea of it

Definition : The amount of memory needed or required by an algorithm to run to completion


An often encountered cause of Space Complexity (Why you would need it) is because of [ Memory Leaks ]

- Memory leaks occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in such
a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released.

- The amount of memory required larger than the memory available on a given system

-

-------------

Final Verdict

- Space Complexity is not as big of an issue as Time Complexity,
Space can always be reused, whereas time cannot.
