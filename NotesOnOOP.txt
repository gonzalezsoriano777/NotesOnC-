- Inheritance

-Opinion wise thought

Inheritance is seen as a shortcut for more cleaner, shorter and understandable code.
The idea is that you are able to create a good amount of classes but too much code isn't as efficent as it seems

-----------------

With inheritance you are able to create one class that can store properties
from another class and not have to repeat that same property(Repetitive Code).

-----------------

Inheritance can use any kind of method made and can use properties from different classes
and you can include those properties from that other class and not repeat code.

---------

- Facts

Some languages can use more then one Inheritance

Ex. Human : GeneralObject, ColorEye These are two methods into one Method and
those 2 are inheriting their properties into Humans

-----------------

Example is creating a blueprint that can have 3 classes and reduce the code by using Inheritance
