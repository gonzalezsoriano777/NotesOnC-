- Inheritance

-Opinion wise thought

Inheritance is seen as a shortcut for more cleaner, shorter and understandable code.
The idea is that you are able to create a good amount of classes but too much code isn't as efficent as it seems

-----------------

With inheritance you are able to create one class that can store properties
from another class and not have to repeat that same property

-----------------

Inheritance uses any kind of method made and can create properties from different classes
and you can include those properties from that method and transfer them into another one
by calling the class itself.
