// Notes

Focus on the clear Idea...

WIDTH should revolve around creating the structure of the board
...// This will be the "|" since each square tile will stores a char.
--------------------------------------------------------------
HEIGHT should be based of the characters used for the drawboard
...// It will store the characters we will use, "X,Y"
                            Like a Tic Tac Toe Board
