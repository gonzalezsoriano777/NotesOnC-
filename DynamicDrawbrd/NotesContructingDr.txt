WIDTH should revolve around creating the structure of the board
...// This will be the "|" since each square tile will stores a char.
--------------------------------------------------------------
HEIGHT should be based of the characters used for the drawboard
...// It will store the characters we will use, "-+"
                    Like a Tic Tac Toe Board struct
